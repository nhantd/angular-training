## Unit 1 Lab

1. Explore and get familiar with the AngularJS documentation  
Note that the AngularJS 1.x documentation is [angularjs.org](http://angularjs.org) while the 2.x documentation is on [angular.io](http://angular.io).	
2. Get the AngularJS file (either via bower or download it) and store it in a local folder as we'll be reusing this file later on

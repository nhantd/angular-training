## Unit 6 Lab

1. Put together an application that uses a Factory. 
The application should read JSON data from `./api/actors-harrison.json` and print information about Harrison Ford onto the screen. 
Make sure that his lastname is returned in all capitals and his DOB is showing the UK format of dd / mm / yyyy 
where the month is the string representation of the month, that is, 12 would be December. 
Note: alter date programatically before feeding in to the appropriate filter.
2. Create a Factory that has two methods:
    - one that displays all the titles of the Star Wars films
    - one that displays information about a single Star Wars film
3. Write a controller using the `controllerAs` syntax and display an unordered list of all films

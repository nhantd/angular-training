## Unit 4 Lab

1. Take the previously create application (that iterates over the names) and add a filter so that the name is displayed all in uppercase
2. Add an input box with a binding to a filter that filters the hobbies on request (as you add values to the input box)
3. Add a checkbox button that only displays people above the age of 30 on request (note this will not require you to use a filter, instead think about expressions and ng-show/ng-hide)
4. Update the dropdown created in the previous lab to be grouped by hobby
